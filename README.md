### This is my first GitHub repository

Bitburner is a Cyber Punk browser game, where we have to code
JavaScript, respectively ECMAScript tools to automate processes
within the game.

This is not really near to reallity but is makes a lot of fun and we can
form, improve or reactivate our programming skills. For me it is a
reactivation of old sleeping neurons. **rofl**


Have a lot of fun...
